  <h2>Exploring the Relationship Between Emissions and Climate Disaster Frequency</h2>
  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>The visualization helps the veiwer explore how long-term climate shifts relate to short-term disasters.
     Presenting these datasets together allows us to see if patterns that are not visible when each is viewed individually, 
     without suggesting a direct relationship. </p>
  <h3>Design Rationale</h3>
  <p>We use a stacked bar chart to show the total number of disasters per year while also revealing how different disaster types 
    contribute to that total. A line chart is overlaid using a secondary y-axis to show CO₂ emissions, providing a continuous trend for comparison. 
    Disaster types have a distinct categorical color palette, while the CO₂ line is styled in a neutral charcoal with a light shadow so it remains 
    legible across bars. 
    Interactive controls like region selection, sorting, and disaster-type filtering aid in the exploratory analysis.</p>
  <h3>Data Transformations</h3>
  <p></p>
  <h3>Development Process</h3>
  <p>The development process was shaped by each member’s availability, but our group maintained consistent communication and collaboration throughout. We held ongoing discussions about the project topic, visualization design, desired interactivity, and ways to improve usability and aesthetics.

Nadine set up the GitHub repository and Discord server for coordination, as well as the initial site structure and base styling. Artien, Debby, and Paige refined the project’s analytical direction, shaping the data strategy and graph intention as development progressed. Artien provided the cleaned and filtered dataset, improved the HTML and JavaScript code, and assembled the first working version of the site that includes the data selected.

Debby, Nadine, and Paige contributed enhancements to the graph’s interactivity and visual design, adjusted styling for clarity and cohesion, and collaborated on the final write-up. Overall, our group maintained an open, iterative workflow and supported one another through active discussion and feedback at every stage of the project. 

Overall, the collective time</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>Although CO₂ emissions show a steady long-term increase, climate-related disaster counts vary significantly from year to year, 
    and do not directly track changes in emissions on an annual basis. 
    This suggests that emissions only influence climate risks over larger time scales,
     while individual natural disaster events are shaped by shorter term environmental and regional factors.</p>
